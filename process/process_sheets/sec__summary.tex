Fabrication flow for the SPD/JJ integration process. WSi SNSPDs are integrated with Nb/Si/Nb, externally shunted JJs. This process includes the superconducting thin-film layer and associated Nb wiring and Au resistors, a ground plane, the JJ tri-layer stack and associated PdAu shunt resistor layer, and an upper Nb wiring layer.

The process starts with a thermally oxidized Si wafer with 160\,nm SiO$_2$. 

The entire wafer is clad with oxide, and openings are etched to the bond pads (\textbf{v4}). A Nb ground plane is deposited, and alignment marks are etched in this layer. Features are then etched in the ground plane (\textbf{m0}).
