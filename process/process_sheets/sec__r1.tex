\begin{itemize}
\item Pattern for liftoff
\begin{itemize}
\item Ash: 3\,min
\item Spin: LOR3A @ 2000\,rpm
\item Clean wafer backside if necessary with EBR
\item Bake: 150\,\textcelsius\,\,for 5\,min
\item Spin: SPR660 @ 3000\,rpm, no P20 (recipe: OPTO/3IN-SPR660-NO-3000-LOR IDI)
\item Expose: 220\,mJ/cm$^2$
\item Bake: 110\,\textcelsius\
\item Develop: double puddle, 30\,s, 30\,s
\item Run through spin rinse dry
\item Inspect with microscope
\end{itemize}
\item Deposit Au in Lesker Lab18
\begin{itemize}
\item Load wafer in load lock
\item Pump down
\item Run Plasma clean from vacuum fast
\item Record DC voltage in log book (typical: 245\,V)
\item Plasma clean runs in load lock
\item Transfer wafer to process chamber
\item Deposit: 4\,nm Ti
\item Typical dep params: 0.2\,nm/s; 78\,mA
\item Deposit: 120\,nm Au
\item Typical dep params: 1\,nm/s; 58\,mA
\item Deposit: 4\,nm Ti
\item Transfer wafer to load lock
\item Vent load lock
\item Insert picture of log book entry
\end{itemize}
\item Perform liftoff
\begin{itemize}
\item Begin heating NMP (PG remover) to 150\textcelsius
\item Soak in acetone as long as possible
\item Transfer wafer to dirty acetone beaker
\item Sonicate in dirty for 5\,min
\item Exchange acetone
\item Sonicate in dirty for 5\,min
\item Exchange acetone
\item If all material is visibly lifted off, move to clean acetone beaker
\item If not, repeat until removed, but at least 10\,min sonics in dirty acetone with acetone exchange at 5\,min
\item Sonicate in clean for 5\,min
\item Spray wafer with acetone spray bottle into sink
\item Place wafer in hot NMP
\item Soak wafer in hot NMP for 20\,min
\item Spray wafer with IPA into sink
\item Rinse wafer in beaker with IPA
\item Run through spin rinse dry
\end{itemize}
